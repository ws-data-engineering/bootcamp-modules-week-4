# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of stopPropagation() Method

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js).

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs on stopPropagation()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is event delegation? How is it different from event bubbling?

- Event Bubbling : Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It refers to this scenario: an element receives an event, and this event bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it reaches the root element.

- Stop propagation stops event bubbling.

- Event Delegation : Event delegation is a pattern based upon Event Bubbling. With this pattern, instead of adding event listeners to every child element, you only need to bind the event listener to the parent element.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
